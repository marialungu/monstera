# Button

Buttons are one of the primary components. They are used in an app for the actions a user can perform, such as submitting forms or applying filters.


## Button Types

There are 3 main types of buttons, `primary`, `secondary` or `tertiary`

**Primary** state is used for main actions, such as `Save` or `Login`

**Secondary** state is used for secondary actions, such as `Cancel` or `Delete`

**Tertiary** state is used for navigation and links

<Canvas>
<Story id="button--primary" />
<Story id="button--secondary" />
<Story id="button--tertiary" />
</Canvas>

All buttons can be `disabled` in order to show that they are not usable

<Canvas>
<Story id="button--disabled" />
</Canvas>

## Button Sizes

There are 3 available sizes for buttons, `large`, `medium` or `small`

<Canvas>
<Story id="button--large" />
<Story id="button--medium" />
<Story id="button--small" />
</Canvas>

There is also the option to have a `full-width` button that can fill its parent container.

<Canvas>
<Story id="button--full-width" />
</Canvas>

## Button with icon

Buttons may include an icon, before the label. For this components library we use [`react-feather` icons](https://feathericons.com/) but you can use any `svg` icons

<Canvas>
<Story id="button--with-icon" />
</Canvas>
